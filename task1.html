<p> My name is Diana Ahmed, I am 23 years old from Palestine,
a fresh graduate from An-Najah National University, I studied computer science
and learned several programming languages, including Java and C++.
I took a course in the basics of Dart and flutter .
I am currently interested in the full-stack course because it is in great demand in the labor market, 
and this is the reason for my participation with you in the hope of getting the maximum benefit.</p>
<h2>Nablus : </h2>

<h3>computer science</h3>
<p> the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and algorithmic foundations,
 hardware and software, and their uses for processing information. The discipline of computer science 
includes the study of algorithms and data structures, computer and network design, modeling data and information processes,
 and artificial intelligence. Computer science draws some of its foundations from mathematics 
 and engineering and therefore incorporates techniques from areas such as queueing theory, 
 probability and statistics, and electronic circuit design. Computer science also makes heavy use of hypothesis testing
and experimentation during the conceptualization, design, measurement, and refinement of new algorithms, 
information structures, and computer architectures.</p>
